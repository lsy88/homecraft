# Show Home

This example is based on [Terry's Home](https://terryhu.cn). Serve the repository root with any static server (see the top-level README), then open `examples/terry-home/` in the browser. `npm run serve` cannot preview it: it serves only the built `dist/`.

## Implementation

When the user has not specified dimensions or materials, refer to similar objects in this example.

The character uses the original site's `assets/terry-skin.png`, configured through `home.config.js`. The engine's default green-hoodie character is untouched; visitors arriving from other worlds keep their own skin.

## Colours and Materials

This example mainly uses light oak, black steel and dark green marble. Keep two to three main materials per space by default; the user's requested style takes priority.
